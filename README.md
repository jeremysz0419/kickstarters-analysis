# kickstarter-analysis
This analysis was performed for helping our client Louise understand trends towards a successful play based on historical data we have for kickstarter projects/shows. Per her request, we performed several analysis on how different campaigns' success, failure, and cancellation rates varied based on their launch dates and funding goals. Please see below for our findings, analysis, and suggestions to future approaches. 

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Monthly Launch Date Analysis against Campaign Outcome
The first analysis we performed was to view the number of successful, failed, and cancelled shows based on the month in which they were launched. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether or not campaigns in general were more likely succeed during certain seasons of the year. We performed a pivot table analysis on our database by filtering the parent category for theater campaigns first. We then placed the "Date Created" column against the campaign "Outcomes" within the pivot table and summed the count of outcomes based on launched months. Please note that we have removed the year and quarter as our analysis wanted to only view correlation between months versus the outcome. We further visualized our results with a line graph (please see below).

One of the possible challenges in performing the monthly analysis was to remove elements such as quarters and years. We were able to recognize that by default our pivot table incorporated years and quarters to the analysis and based on Louise's goals we had to remove them from the pivot table. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
While the first analysis performed was to determine the campaign outcomes based on seasonal factors, we wanted to analyze how campaign outcomes correlated with their "goal" amount. The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise find the optimal amount that her kickstarter should aim for in order to find the highest chance in succeeding. We performed this analysis by first setting goal ranges in increments of 5000. Utilizing the "COUNTIFS" function within excel, we filtered the counts based on the goal range, outcome type ("successful", "failed", "canceled"), and the subcategory. We filtered the COUNTIFS function to only count campaigns within the subcategory of "plays" as it was the most relevant subcategory to Louise's project. With our conditional counts completed, we then calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns in each goal range that we set. Please see the outcome of the line graph we created based on the analysis we performed above.
