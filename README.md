# kickstarter-analysis
This analysis was performed for helping our client Louise understand trends towards a successful play based on historical data we have for kickstarter projects/shows. Per her request, we performed several analysis on how different campaigns' success, failure, and cancellation rates varied based on their launch dates and funding goals. Please see below for our findings, analysis, and suggestions to future approaches. 

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Monthly Launch Date Analysis against Campaign Outcome
The first analysis we performed was to view the number of successful, failed, and cancelled shows based on the month in which they were launched. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether or not campaigns in general were more likely succeed during certain seasons of the year. We performed a pivot table analysis on our database by filtering the parent category for theater campaigns first. We then placed the "Date Created" column against the campaign "Outcomes" within the pivot table and summed the count of outcomes based on launched months. Please note that we have removed the year and quarter as our analysis wanted to only view correlation between months versus the outcome. We further visualized our results with a line graph (please see below).

One of the possible challenges in performing the monthly analysis was to remove elements such as quarters and years. We were able to recognize that by default our pivot table incorporated years and quarters to the analysis and based on Louise's goals we had to remove them from the pivot table. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
While the first analysis performed was to determine the campaign outcomes based on seasonal factors, we wanted to analyze how campaign outcomes correlated with their "goal" amount. The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise find the optimal amount that her kickstarter should aim for in order to find the highest chance in succeeding. We performed this analysis by first setting goal ranges in increments of 5000. Utilizing the "COUNTIFS" function within excel, we filtered the counts based on the goal range, outcome type ("successful", "failed", "canceled"), and the subcategory. We filtered the COUNTIFS function to only count campaigns within the subcategory of "plays" as it was the most relevant subcategory to Louise's project. With our conditional counts completed, we then calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns in each goal range that we set. Please see the outcome of the line graph we created based on the analysis we performed above.

One of the challenges faced in this analysis was utilizing multiple filters within the COUNTIF function. Originally we were aiming to use the COUNTIF function to count the number of outcomes based on the goal range that we have set. However, we realized that we also needed to filter for the subcategory and outcome type. The COUNTIF function can only count with one parameter and thus we had to use the COUNTIFS function so that we could nest all of our parameters/filters. 

## Results
### Launch Date Conclusion
Based on our findings of the Monthly Launch Date, we can conclude that theatrical campaigns rarely have any cancellations regardless of the month that they were launched on. Furthermore the amounts of failed campaigns are about half the amount of successful campaigns. In addition, the number of failures seem to be unaffected by the month in which the project was launched as the number seemed consistent throughout the year. However, the same cannot be said for the number of successful campagins. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that campaigns are most likely to succeed during the summer time. The trend we can observe is that success rates spike to the highest in May, June, and eventually normalizing around September. From this we can conclude that a seasonal factor is at play and campaigns get more traction during the summer months when demand is higher.

### Goals and Outcomes Conclusion
Based on our analysis on campaign outcomes based on the goal amount, we can see that there is a general inverse trend between the successful and failed campaigns. However, this could slightly be skewed as we did not include live campaigns in our analysis. Furthermore, within the subcategory of "Plays", we find that ther were no canceled campaigns. We find that plays with lower asked goals are more likely to succeed. With 75.81% of kickstarters within the "play" subcategory succeeding and almost none succeeding in highest goal ranges. The only case in which there was a dramatic difference from the general trend was in the 35,000 to 39,999 goal range. In this once instance, we see that plays had a surprisingly good rate of succeeding while only 33% percent failed. However, when we remove this one exception, the general trend showed that success rate declined as goal amounts increased. Therefore, our recommendation to Louise is to stick to the lower amounts of goals asked for a higher chance of success.

## Limitations and Future Recommendations
While our analysis did have some interesting findings, there were several factors that were not considered in our analysis. With our database containing so many parameters and factors, it is important to perform analysis on all the possible factors to determine which ones hold true significance. By isolating a few numbers, categories, and timelines, we can hardly say with confidence that the correlation between them are strong. An example would be our Outcome Based on Launch Date. While there seemed to be a correlation, the year and quarter could have also played a significant factor in the success/failure rate of kickstarters. For future analysis, we recommend to approach with more statistical analysis and be more inclusive with our data. Furthermore, by providing a box and whiskers plot, we can easily see outliers, averages, and variance of our data. This can help us provide Louise with a general overview of what the real trend is. Perhaps there were more outliers and the variancce was incredibly high in our data. Our analysis failed to take into account of these factors. Running ANOVAs and regressional analysis can help determine which factors are truly statistically significant to our research and thus can provide better conclusions to Louise.
